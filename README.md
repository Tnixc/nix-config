This is a [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) config for a 13-inch M3 MacBook Air. It's based on [nix-darwin-kickstarter](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter). It mainly uses [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), and few programs are configured in nix. This is because it is often easier to find documentation for configuring software with their original schemas. The wallpapers are modified versions of [Raycast wallpapers](https://www.raycast.com/wallpapers).

The color scheme is my theme [edo](https://github.com/tnixc/edo). Some fonts I use are `Basier Square Mono` and `Berkeley Mono`.

### Some programs
- bar: [sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)
- terminal: kitty
- window manager: yabai
